AWS CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository service that can be used by organizations
to securely store, publish, and share software packages used in their software development
process. CodeArtifact can be configured to automatically fetch software packages and
dependencies from public artifact repositories so developers have access to the latest versions.

Software development teams increasingly rely on open-source packages to perform common tasks
in their application package. It has become critical for software development teams to maintain
control on a particular version of the open-source software to ensure the software is free of
vulnerabilities. With CodeArtifact, you can set up controls to enforce this.

CodeArtifact works with commonly used package managers and build tools such as Maven, Gradle,
npm, yarn, twine, and pip, making it easy to integrate into existing development workflows.

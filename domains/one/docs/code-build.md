## AWS Documentation

*Source: [Introduction to DevOps on AWS (AWS CodeBuild)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/introduction-devops-aws.pdf#aws-codebuild)*

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs
tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. You donâ€™t need to provision,
manage, and scale your own build servers. CodeBuild can use either of GitHub, GitHub Enterprise,
BitBucket, AWS CodeCommit, or Amazon S3 as a source provider.

CodeBuild scales continuously and can process multiple builds concurrently. CodeBuild offers
various pre-configured environments for various versions of Microsoft Windows and Linux.
Customers can also bring their customized build environments as Docker containers. CodeBuild
also integrates with open source tools such as Jenkins and Spinnaker.

CodeBuild can also create reports for unit, functional, or integration tests. These reports provide
a visual view of how many tests cases were run and how many passed or failed. The build process
can also be run inside an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) which can be helpful if your
integration services or databases are deployed inside a VPC.

## Required Knowledge

- Accepts CodeCommit, S3, Bitbucket and GitHub as code sources
- Build instructions
    - buildspec.yml file recommended
    - Can also use manual config via console
- Log output to CloudWatch and S3
    - CloudWatch Metrics to monitor statistics
    - CloudWatch alarms can provide info on failure thresholds
- EventBridge to detect failed builds and trigger notifications
- Projects can be created directly in CodeBuild or via CodePipeline (regardless, they're still projects *in* CodeBuild)

- Process
    - CodeBuild pulls from source, including the buildspec.yml file
    - Pulls the desired environment from either a prebuilt Docker image or a custom one
    - CodeBuild runs instructions in the buildspec.yml
    - Can include optimizations allowing some files to be cached in S3 between builds to speed things up
    - Can log to CloudWatch and/or S3
    - Runs test
    - Produces artifacts which are placed into an S3 bucket
- local builds
    - Troubleshooting builds locally is possible with Docker/CodeBuild Agent
- Inside VPC
    - By default CodeBuild containers are launched outside a VPC
    - It is possible to specify a VPC config with the build to enable resources within the VPC
    - Use cases include integration tests, data query, and internal LBs

    - Some are defined and provided by AWS
        - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
        - `CODEBUILD_BUILD_ARN`
        - `CODEBUILD_BUILD_ID`
        - `CODEBUILD_BUILD_IMAGE`

        - Dynamic from SSM param store and Secrets Manager
- Security
    - Build specific service role
    - In-transit and at-rest data encryption
    - Artifact encryption
- Build badges (public URL)
- Triggers
    - CodeCommit -> EventBridge -> CodeBuild
    - Could also shove a Lambda before the build for preparatory actions
    - GitHub -> Webhook -> CodeBuild
- Reports
    - Can get visual test reports from CodeBuild UI
    - Not necessary to view logs
    - Accepts JUnit, NUnit, NUnit3, Cucumber, TestNG, VisualStudio TRX

    - possible to override the default buildspec filename and location
    - Can use different files for different builds in same repo, such as `buildspec_debug.yml` and `buildspec_release.yml`
    - Can also store a buildspec file other than the source root
    - Only one buildspec is permitted per project

## Console Lab

### Create a CodeBuild Project

*Note: The test case is pretty contrived here, but we'll see better and more extensive examples of
CodeBuild when we start integrating with CodePipeline and CodeDeploy.*

1. Create a new secret in Secrets Manager; this will be the result expected by our unit tests:
    - Secret type: `Other type of secret`
    - Key/Value pair: `TEST_EXPECTED_RESULT: 107`
    - Secret name: `demo-build/secrets`
1. Create two new parameters in the Systems Manager Parameter Store; this will store input values
used by our unit tests:
    - Parameter 1:
        - Name: `/demo-build/data-point`
        - Type: `String`
        - Value: `5`
    - Parameter 2:
        - Name: `/demo-build/coefficients`
        - Type: `StringList`
        - Value: `3,6,2`
1. Commit the contents of the [code-build lab folder](../labs/code-build/) to the main branch
of the CodeCommit repository you created in the [CodeCommit lab](./code-commit.md#console-lab).
1. Create a new CodeBuild project and give it a suitable name.  Set the source provider to "AWS
CodeCommit", and select therepo to which you committed the lab files.  Choose the main branch. Leave
all the environment settings at their defaults. Have AWS create a new service role, name it and
note the name down. Under the "Buildspec" section, select "Use a buildspec file".  Under "Artifacts", set
the type for Artifact 1 to "Amazon S3". Select a bucket in the same region as your CodeBuild
project. Under "Artifacts packaging", select "Zip".  Leave all other options at their defaults.
1. Find the role that was created for the new build project (it will have "-service-name" appended
to the name you chose above). Note that AWS attached a policy with many of the permissions required,
but you'll need to add an additional inline policy:
    - Actions:
        - ssm:GetParameters
        - secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
    - Resources: "*"
1. Return to your CodeBuild project and start a new build. As the build progresses, note the log
output.  The unit test attempts to display all of the values used to conduct the test.  However,
since they mostly come either from Parameter Store or Secrets manager, they are not logged;
CodeBuild hides the output. The only value logged is the one set as a basic environment variable:
"Solution".  Even when the test attempts to logged the *calculated* value, it is obscured.  You can
even add "echo 107" to the buildspec, but 107 will be obscured because it is the same as a secret
value.

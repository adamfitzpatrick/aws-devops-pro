## AWS Documentation

*Source: [Introduction to DevOps on AWS (EC2 Image Builder)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/introduction-devops-aws.pdf#ec2-image-builder)*

EC2 Image Builder is a fully managed AWS service that helps you to automate the creation,
maintenance, validation, sharing, and deployment of customized, secure, and up-to-date Linux or
Windows custom AMI. EC2 Image Builder can also be used to create container images. You can use
the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or APIs to create custom images in your AWS account.

EC2 Image Builder significantly reduces the effort of keeping images up-to-date and secure by
providing a simple graphical interface, built-in automation, and AWS-provided security settings.
With EC2 Image Builder, there are no manual steps for updating an image nor do you have to build
your own automation pipeline.

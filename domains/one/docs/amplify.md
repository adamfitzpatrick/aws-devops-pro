## AWS Documentation

*Source: [Amplify Dev Center](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/how-amplify-works/)*

Amplify empowers developers with a flexible collection of modular cloud services and libraries for fullstack application development. Each capability is designed to integrate with the others, while also remaining standalone for customized implementations. Developers can mix and match Amplify capabilities based on their project needs, leveraging only the required building blocks. For example, a developer could use Amplify’s data functionality for their fullstack app’s backend and frontend, just host their app’s frontend, or connect their user interface to an existing AWS resource like an Amazon S3 bucket. This guide explores the different capabilities Amplify provides and how you can use them together or independently.

**Amplify Capabilities**

Amplify provides tooling for building app backends, connecting app frontends to backend resources, and hosting frontend apps.

For end-to-end fullstack development, you would use Amplify to host your app’s frontend, provision backend resources either visually or through a command line, and build your app’s frontend user interface with Figma-to-code generation and Amplify’s frontend libraries. While this diagram shows a complete Amplify flow, you can also use each piece independently—for example, just host your frontend or use UI components to build out your app’s frontend.
